# Autonomous-PiCar
Takes on autonomous algorithms (e.g Q-learning, NN) with Raspberry Pi 3 and SunFounder PiCar-V as a body.

Hi there.

I don't know how you found me, but I'm Viktor Cef Ä°nselberg and this is my Senior Design Project (Senior thesis) for my Computer Engineering BSc degree in MEF University. I have built myself a model car with ultrasonic sensors, based on the mini-computer Raspberry Pi 3.


I will be attempting in observing the learning capabilities of the car that I have built, and go through numerous AI models to determine one with satisfactory outcome.
