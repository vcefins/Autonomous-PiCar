# Autonomous-PiCar
A Raspberry Pi 3 with SunFounder PiCar-V as a body and numerous ultrasonic sensors to fully build a model autonomous car from the ground up.

Hi there.

I'm Viktor Cef Inselberg and this is my Senior Design Project (Senior thesis) for my Computer Engineering BSc degree in MEF University. I have built myself a model car for my senior thesis, and it turned out pretty fine.
